Currently a Sophomore at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus. Completed my high school from Delhi. A [KVPY Scholar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kishore_Vaigyanik_Protsahan_Yojana). 
Getting my hands dirty on convolution neural network(Thanks to [cs231](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)) and data mining/IR for my present projects. Started as a backend-developer which led to creation of quite a few projects, besides it made me very much confident in django as well as in python. Real time applications have fascinated me and somehow I managed to play with websockets in javascript and python(it is fun though! :p). More of my [geeky stuff](#).

Besides programming, I love F.R.I.E.N.D.S and the two things I love about Chandler:
